# Homemade 6-Pack Tesla Coil ⚡️


### Key Components

- Neon Sign Transformer (NST): Steps up 120V AC to about 10kV for the spark gap.
- Six-Pack Capacitor: Made from pouring salt water in 6 glass bottles and topped it off with mineral oil to hold in the eletrons, similar to the champagne bottles Tesla used.
- Primary and Secondary Coils: low gauge for the secondary coil and higher gauge for primary coil.
- Spark Gap: The spark gap acts like a switch for the Tesla Coil. The air in the gap is an insulator - until the voltage on the capacitor connected to the gap rises high enough to make a spark and bridge the gap.
- Terry Filter: The Terry Filter protects the neon sign transformer from any RFI getting into the NST and also any 'over voltage' situation that would harm the coil.

## Safety First

Building and operating a Tesla coil comes with significant safety risks. Always make sure that:
- The capacitor is discharged before touching any of the parts.
- The coil is operated far from flammable materials and sensitive electronics.
- You use proper eye.
- The machine should operate in a well-ventilated area (ideally outside)
## Build Steps

Here’s a quick summary of the building steps that I went through:

1. Wind the Secondary Coil: Wrapped a PVC pipe with very high gauge copper magnet wire, ensuring smooth, close winding (any overlap in wiring can cause in the coil being broken).
2. Install the Secondary Coil Terminals: Connected the ends of the wire to secure terminals.
3. Build the Top-Load: Created a toroid shape to act as the top-load the plasma will discharge from here.
4. Construct the Six-Pack Capacitor: Used glass bottles filled with saltwater as the capacitor.
5. Build the Primary Coil: Made from copper tubing, carefully spaced around the secondary coil.
6. Assemble and Tuning: Put all components together and tuned the coil for optimal arcing.

## The Results

After careful assembly, the tesla coil produced some impressive sparks off of the top load!
