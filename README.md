# ⚡️ Homemade Tesla Coil ⚡️

Hey everyone!

I wanted to post a project that I worked a few years ago. This is my Homemade Tesla Coil! 

## Project Overview

This project was not only a fun build but also a great learning experience about high-frequency alternating currents.

### Key Components

- Neon Sign Transformer (NST)**: Steps up 120V AC to about 10kV.
- Six-Pack Capacitor: Made from glass beverage bottles, similar to the champagne bottles Tesla used.
- Primary and Secondary Coils: Air-core, dual-resonant transformer design.
- Spark Gap: The spark gap acts like a switch. The air in the gap is an insulator - until the voltage on the capacitor connected to the gap rises high enough to make a spark. 

## Safety First!

Building and operating a Tesla coil comes with significant safety risks. Always ensure that:
- The capacitor is discharged before touching any components.
- The coil is operated far from flammable materials and sensitive electronics.
- You use proper eye and ear protection.
- You operate in a well-ventilated area due to the production of hazardous gases.

## Build Steps

Here’s a quick rundown of the building process that I went through:

1. Wind the Secondary Coil: Wrapped a PVC pipe with magnet wire, ensuring smooth, close winding.
2. Install the Secondary Coil Terminals: Connected the ends of the wire to secure terminals.
3. Build the Top-Load: Created a toroid shape to act as the top-load capacitor.
4. Construct the Six-Pack Capacitor**: Used glass bottles filled with saltwater as the capacitor.
5. Build the Primary Coil: Made from copper tubing, carefully spaced around the secondary coil.
6. Assemble and Tune: Put all components together and tuned the coil for optimal performance.

## The Result

After careful assembly and tuning, the Tesla coil produced some impressive sparks! It's mesmerizing to watch and definitely a crowd-pleaser.
